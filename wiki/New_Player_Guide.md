### Joining the Server

*If you are familiar with the BYOND platform, you can skip this
section.*

  - First, you need to download BYOND. Get the Windows installer
    [1](http://www.byond.com/download/build/512/512.1462_byond.exe)
    (\<10MB). Linux is only for hosting - If you have Linux or MacOS,
    use a virtual machine. (*We recommend installing BYOND so you can
    launch the game from links, but if you prefer you can download the
    zip version
    [2](http://www.byond.com/download/build/512/512.1462_byond.zip).*)
  - After installing it (or extracting the ZIP folder), open the **bin**
    folder and click on **byond.exe**. You will see a hub with several
    games on the left. Search for **Space Station 13** to see the list
    of games. Scroll down until you see **Civilization 13** and press
    Join. It will then download all the game files (around 50MB) and the
    game will start automatically.
  - You are now in the Lobby - Before you join, make sure to read the
    **[Rules](Rules "wikilink")**.
