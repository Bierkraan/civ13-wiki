# Voyage

Avast! Set sail on the high seas of adventure aboard the Good Ship; a two masted, 12 cannon pirate vessel during the golden age of piracy. Pursue plunder and peril, though not necessarily in that order, across the Caribbean sea. Transform your impoverished boat and crew into a force to be reckoned with and work together to become rich beyond your wildest imaginings!

## Roles

### Superior Officer Roles

The **Captain** is responsible for plotting the ship's course.

The **Boatswain** is the Head of Personel of the ship. He can use the Officer tab to assign jobs to regular sailors (but not officers). He can use the *Crew Log Book* to check the active crew members and respective jobs.

The **Quartermaster** is Head of Logistics. He is responsible for ensuring the ship's stocks are kept at a decent level. He can use the *Log Book* to check the current stocks stored below deck.

### Sailor Roles

**Sailor** is a generic role assigned by default to sailors. They're supposed to help wherever it might be needed.

The **Surgeon** is a specialist role, responsible for keeping the crew healthy.

A **Nurse** is a sailor assigned to support the Surgeon. While he doesn't have the same level of medical knowledge, he can still be useful in a ship with not enough Surgeons.

**Carpenter**

**Marine**

**Cannonier**

**Navigator**

**Officer**

**Cook**

The **Deputy Boatswain** and **Deputy Quartermaster** are the second in command to the Boatswain and Quartermaster respectively, and can replace them if they get injured or killed.

### Ships
There are 6 ship classes ingame. The starting player's ship is a **Flute** (size 3)

| Ship | Size | Image | Cannons (top/bottom - total) | Crew | Description |
| -------- | --- | ---------------- | ------------ | --- | ------------------------------- |
| Xebec | 1 | ![ship1](assets/images/voyage/ship1.png) | 6/0 - 6 | 10 | The smallest ship, this single-deck, single-mast ship packs 6 cannons and a small crew. There is no cargo hull so loot will be smaller. |
| Schooner | 2 | ![ship2](assets/images/voyage/ship2.png) | 4/0 - 4 | 20 | This fast ship has a sizeable cargo hull, but also packs a decent amount of crew for its size. Only has cannons on top deck. |
| Flute | 3 | ![ship3](assets/images/voyage/ship3.png) | 6/4 - 10 | 15 | This swift, double masted ship has a small-ish crew, but packs a good punch in terms of firepower. |
| Brig | 4 | ![ship4](assets/images/voyage/ship4.png) | 6/10 - 16 | 40 | The Brig is a long ship with a large crew. |
| Galleon | 5 | ![ship5](assets/images/voyage/ship5.png) | 16/16 - 32 | 50 | The Galleon is a large, wide ship with a massive amount of cannons and a considerable cargo hull. |
| Man-O-War | 6 | ![ship6](assets/images/voyage/ship6.png) | 24/24 - 48 | 65 | This is a massive ship, and you probably shouldn't take it head-on unless you have a sizable crew and several cannons. |
