## Roles

### Superior Officer Roles

The **Captain** is responsible for plotting the ship's course.

The **Boatswain** is the Head of Personel of the ship. He can use the Officer tab to assign jobs to regular sailors (but not officers). He can use the *Crew Log Book* to check the active crew members and respective jobs.

The **Quartermaster** is Head of Logistics. He is responsible for ensuring the ship's stocks are kept at a decent level. He can use the *Log Book* to check the current stocks stored below deck.

### Sailor Roles

**Sailor** is a generic role assigned by default to sailors. They're supposed to help wherever it might be needed.

The **Surgeon** is a specialist role, responsible for keeping the crew healthy.

A **Nurse** is a sailor assigned to support the Surgeon. While he doesn't have the same level of medical knowledge, he can still be useful in a ship with not enough Surgeons.

**Carpenter**

**Marine**

**Cannonier**

**Navigator**

**Officer**

**Cook**

The **Deputy Boatswain** and **Deputy Quartermaster** are the second in command to the Boatswain and Quartermaster respectively, and can replace them if they get injured or killed.

### Ships
There are 6 ship classes ingame. The starting player's ship is a **Brig** (size 4)
#### Xebec (size 1)
**Cannons(top/bottom - total): 6/0 - 6**
**Crew: approx. 10**
The smallest ship, this single-deck, single-mast ship packs 6 cannons and a small crew. There is no cargo hull so loot will be smaller.

#### Schooner (size 2)
**Cannons(top/bottom - total): 4/0 - 4**
**Crew: approx. 20**
This fast ship has a sizeable cargo hull, but also packs a decent amount of crew for its size. Only has cannons on top deck.

#### Flute (size 3)
**Cannons(top/bottom - total): 6/4 - 10**
**Crew: approx. 15**
This swift, double masted ship has a small-ish crew, but packs a good punch in terms of firepower.

#### Brig (size 4)
**Cannons(top/bottom - total): 6/10 - 16**
**Crew: approx. 40**
The Brig is a long ship with a large crew.

#### Galleon (size 5)
**Cannons(top/bottom - total): 16/16 - 32**
**Crew: approx. 50**
The Galleon is a large, wide ship with a massive amount of cannons and a considerable cargo hull.

#### Man-O-War (size 6)
**Cannons(top/bottom - total): 24/24 - 48**
**Crew: approx. 65**
This is a massive ship, and you probably shouldn't take it head-on unless you have a sizable crew and several cannons.
